# Automated Comic Archiving and Tagging Workflow for Kavita

Have you ever meticulously organized your digital comic collection into a perfect folder structure, only to import it into a media server like [Kavita](https://www.kavita.zip/) and watch it get dumped onto the digital floor in one giant, unsorted pile?

The problem is usually missing metadata. While powerful tools like [Comic Tagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger) exist, they often require manual intervention to get started. To get reliable results, you have to search for each series by handâ€”an impossible task when you have thousands of comics.

This project was created to solve that exact problem. I automated it.

This workflow uses the folder structure you *already have* as a guide. It sets up a fully automated "inbox" system. You simply drop new, unprocessed comics into a folder, and a scheduled script handles the rest. It turns a manual chore into a "set it and forget it" solution.

## What It Does

The Python script (`process_inbox.py`) runs on a schedule and automates a four-stage process for any new comics it finds:

1.  **Archive:** It scans the "inbox" for issue folders containing images (e.g., `.jpg` files) and compresses each one into a new `.cbz` file, deleting the original folder on success.
2.  **Tag & Rename:** It uses the [Comic Tagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger) CLI to fetch metadata from Comic Vine, embed it into the archive, and rename the file to a clean, standardized format.
3.  **Move:** It moves the newly processed comic folders from the inbox into your main library directory, merging them if the series already exists.
4.  **Scan:** It triggers an incremental library scan in Kavita via its API, so your new comics appear automatically.

Any files that cannot be automatically parsed are logged to `inbox_skipped.log` for manual review.

## Installation

These instructions are for a Debian-based system (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS, Debian, Ubuntu).

1.  **Download the Install Script:**
    Download the `install.sh` file from this repository to your server.

2.  **Make the Script Executable:**
    Open a terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the Script:**
    Execute the script to install all necessary system dependencies and set up Comic Tagger in a dedicated project folder (`~/comictagger_project`).
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```
    You may be prompted for your password to install system packages.

4.  **Install `requests` library:**
    The inbox script needs one additional Python library to communicate with the Kavita API.
    ```bash
    # Activate the virtual environment created by the install script
    source ~/comictagger_project/venv/bin/activate
    
    # Install requests
    pip install requests
    ```

## The Workflow: Setting Up Your Automated Inbox

### Step 1: Create the Inbox Folder

On your server, create a dedicated folder where you will drop new comics. This should be separate from your main library but can be on the same drive.

```bash
# Example:
mkdir -p /mnt/kavitacomics/inbox
```

### Step 2: Get Your API Keys

You will need two API keys for the script to function.

1.  **Comic Vine API Key:**
    *   Sign up for a free account at [comicvine.gamespot.com/api/](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/).
    *   Copy the API key provided.
    *   On your server, save this key into a plain text file (e.g., `/home/user/.comic_vine_api_key`).

2.  **Kavita API Key:**
    *   Log into your Kavita web interface.
    *   Click your user icon in the top right and go to **My Profile**.
    *   Under the "API Key" section, copy your key.

### Step 3: Configure the Inbox Script

Before running, you **must** edit the configuration variables at the top of the `process_inbox.py` script:

-   `INBOX_DIR`: The absolute path to the "inbox" folder you created in Step 1.
-   `LIBRARY_DIR`: The absolute path to your main comic library where processed comics should be moved.
-   `COMIC_TAGGER_EXE`: The path to the `comictagger` executable. The install script places this at `~/comictagger_project/venv/bin/comictagger`.
-   `API_KEY_FILE`: The absolute path to the file where you saved your Comic Vine API key.
-   `KAVITA_API_KEY`: Paste the key you copied from your Kavita profile here.
-   `SKIPPED_FILES_LOG`: The path where you want the log file for skipped files to be saved.

### Step 4: Test the Script Manually

Before automating, it's wise to test the script once.

1.  **Drop a new comic folder** into your `inbox` directory.
2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment** in your terminal:
    ```bash
    source ~/comictagger_project/venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python3 /path/to/your/process_inbox.py
    ```
    Watch the output. The script should find the comic, archive it, tag it, move it, and trigger a Kavita scan. Check your Kavita library to see if the new comic appears.

### Step 5: Automate with Cron (The Scheduler)

Once you've confirmed the script works, you can schedule it to run automatically.

1.  **Open the cron editor:**
    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```
    *(If it's your first time, select `nano` as your editor).*

2.  **Add the scheduled job:**
    Scroll to the bottom of the file and add the following line. This example runs the script every night at 3:00 AM.
    ```
    0 3 * * * /home/user/comictagger_project/venv/bin/python3 /path/to/your/process_inbox.py >> /home/user/inbox_processing.log 2>&1
    ```
    *   **Important:** Make sure to use the correct absolute paths for your user.
    *   `>> /home/user/inbox_processing.log 2>&1` saves all script output to a log file for easy troubleshooting.

3.  Save and exit the editor. The cron job is now active.

### Your Daily Workflow

Your setup is complete. From now on, your workflow is simple:
1.  Download a new comic.
2.  Drag and drop the unprocessed folder into your `inbox`.
3.  The scheduled script will handle the rest overnight.
