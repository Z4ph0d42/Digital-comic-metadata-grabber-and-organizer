# Automated Comic Archiving and Tagging Workflow for Kavita

Have you ever meticulously organized your digital comic collection into a perfect folder structure, only to import it into a media server like [Kavita](https://www.kavita.zip/) and watch it get dumped onto the digital floor in one giant, unsorted pile?

The problem is usually missing metadata. While powerful tools like [Comic Tagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger) exist, they often require manual intervention to get started. To get reliable results, you have to search for each series by handâ€”an impossible task when you have thousands of comics.

This project was created to solve that exact problem. I automated it.

This workflow uses the folder structure you *already have* as a guide. It provides two main scripts:
1.  `process_full_library.py`: A powerful, one-time script to convert your entire existing library of unprocessed comics into a perfectly tagged and organized collection.
2.  `process_inbox.py`: A script designed to be run on a schedule, which automatically processes new comics dropped into an "inbox" folder and adds them to your library and Kavita.

Any files that cannot be automatically parsed are logged for manual review.

## Installation

These instructions are for a Debian-based system (e.g., Raspberry Pi OS, Debian, Ubuntu).

1.  **Download the Install Script:**
    Download the `install.sh` file from this repository to your server.

2.  **Make the Script Executable:**
    Open a terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    chmod +x install.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the Script:**
    Execute the script to install all necessary system dependencies and set up Comic Tagger in a dedicated project folder (`~/comictagger_project`).
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```
    You may be prompted for your password to install system packages.

4.  **Install `requests` library:**
    The inbox script needs one additional Python library to communicate with the Kavita API.
    ```bash
    # Activate the virtual environment created by the install script
    source ~/comictagger_project/venv/bin/activate
    
    # Install requests
    pip install requests
    ```

## The Workflow

The workflow is divided into two parts: a one-time setup for your existing library, and then the ongoing automation for new comics.

### Part 1: Initial Library Conversion

Use the `process_full_library.py` script for this.

1.  **Get Your Comic Vine API Key:**
    *   Sign up for a free account at [comicvine.gamespot.com/api/](https://comicvine.gamespot.com/api/).
    *   Copy the API key provided and save it to a plain text file on your server (e.g., `/home/user/.comic_vine_api_key`).

2.  **Configure the Script:**
    *   Edit the configuration variables at the top of the `process_full_library.py` script to match your system's paths.
    *   **Crucially, leave `DRY_RUN = True` for the first run.**

3.  **Execute the Script:**
    *   Activate the virtual environment: `source ~/comictagger_project/venv/bin/activate`
    *   Run a **Dry Run** to test: `python3 /path/to/your/process_full_library.py`
    *   If the output looks correct, change `DRY_RUN` to `False` in the script and run it again to process your entire library. This will take a long time.

4.  **Final Kavita Scan:**
    *   Once the script finishes, go to your Kavita web UI, **Delete** and **Re-add** your comics library to ensure a clean import.

### Part 2: Ongoing Automation with the Inbox

Use the `process_inbox.py` script for this.

1.  **Create an Inbox Folder** on your server where you will drop new comics (e.g., `/path/to/your/inbox`).

2.  **Get Your Kavita API Key:**
    *   In your Kavita UI, go to **My Profile** and copy your API Key.

3.  **Configure the Script:**
    *   Edit the configuration variables at the top of the `process_inbox.py` script, including your paths and pasting in your Kavita API key.

4.  **Test the Script Manually:**
    *   Drop a new comic folder into your `inbox`.
    *   Activate the virtual environment and run `python3 /path/to/your/process_inbox.py`.
    *   Check if the comic is processed correctly and appears in Kavita.

5.  **Automate with Cron (The Scheduler):**
    *   Open the cron editor: `crontab -e`
    *   Add a line to schedule the script. This example runs it every night at 3:00 AM:
        ```
        0 3 * * * /home/user/comictagger_project/venv/bin/python3 /path/to/your/process_inbox.py >> /home/user/inbox_processing.log 2>&1
        ```
    *   Save and exit. Your automated system is now live.
